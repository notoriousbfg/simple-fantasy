## Simple Fantasy

A very crude tool that lists the "perfect team" for a Premier League fantasy gameweek. It factors in these traits, in the following order:
1) The estimated "difficulty" of the fixture.
2) A player's form.
3) A player's ICT index.
4) A player's likelihood of playing.

e.g.

<img src="./img.png" />

### Usage
```
./simple-fantasy -gameweek 10 -player Solanke
```
